(1) Basic Inverse Kinematics
----------------------------
Robot in free floating. No sensor feedback except the joint proprio.
Bring one op-point to desired position.
	ik_arm:	    op-point=right hand
	ik_leg:     op-point=left feet
The task error is recorded. Just check the exponential decrease.

(2) Basic IK + joint limit stopper
----------------------------------
Same test as (1), and play with the desired position to push the robot
behind its jl. Check that the JointLimit is enforced.


(3) Basic IK + sensor passive
-----------------------------
Same test as (1). The angle of the flexibility and drift
are computed from the rotation sensor, and logged. 
Two points to consider:
- the noise of the sensor when the robot waist is not moving.
- vibration in the sensor measurement when the flexibility is exited

(4) Basic IK + sensor
---------------------
Same test as (1), but using the KF sensor to compute the ff position.
In order to avoid undesired joint-limit blocking, the chest is not used
to fullfil the task. Chest being not used, the robot can stand on the ground.
Three points to consider:
- the noise of the sensor when the robot waist is not moving.
- vibration in the sensor measurement when the flexibility is exited
- compensatory motions of the arm when the waist is disturbed.

(5) Basic IK + sensor + velocity
--------------------------------
Same test as (4), but using the KF velocity estimation as q0 entry of the sot.
In order to avoid undesired joint-limit blocking, the chest is not used
to fullfil the task. Chest being not used, the robot can stand on the ground.
Main point to consider:
- compensatory motions of the arm when the waist is disturbed.

(1) Basic COM-XY
----------------
No sensor feedback. Both feet on the ground.
Task twofeet has priority. Task Com in second range: dim 2, Z is unactive. 

(2) Basic COM-XY + sensor
-------------------------
Same as (1) but with a feedback on the rotation sensor used to compute the position 
of the waist.
