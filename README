This package contains scripts for operation of the stack of tasks (SoT - see package sot-core for more information) with openHRP. 
Two different sorts of scripts are provided: example python scripts for openhrp (the most relevant being sotWalkTask.py) and 
(necessary) initialisation scripts for the stack of tasks (written in the SoT scripting language).
The version of openhrp currently supported is: version 3.0.5; the scripts have been tested with the robot HRP2-10.

By building this package, you install the scripts in two different installation directories:
- your ${OPENHRP_HOME}/Controller/IOServer/${ROBOT}/scripts directory for python scripts;
- your ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/scripts directory for SOT scripts
